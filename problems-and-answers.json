    "aiExplanation": "This code is designed to solve the problem of finding two numbers in an array that sum up to a given target value. The function `twoSum` takes two parameters: `nums`, which is a list of integers, and `target`, the integer value we're trying to find by summing two unique numbers from the list. The function uses a dictionary named `store` to keep track of the integers we have seen so far and their corresponding indices in the list.\n\nAs we iterate through the list using a for-loop, each iteration gives us both the index `idx` and the integer `n` at that index. In each iteration, we calculate the `remainder`, which is the difference between the `target` and the current number `n`. This `remainder` represents the number that, when added to `n`, would result in the target value.\n\nIf the `remainder` already exists in the `store` dictionary, it means we have previously encountered a number such that the sum of this number and our current number equals the target. In this case, we can immediately return the indices of these two numbers: `store.get(remainder)` and `idx`.\n\nIf the `remainder` is not found in `store`, we add the current number `n` to the dictionary with its index `idx` as the value. This way, as we continue to iterate through the list, we build up a record of numbers we've seen and their positions, allowing us to quickly check for the complementary number needed to reach the target.\n\nThe beauty of this approach lies in its efficiency. By using a dictionary to record and look up numbers, the solution achieves an average time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, making it very efficient for larger datasets."

    "title": "Add Two Numbers",
    "aiExplanation": "This solution tackles the problem of adding two numbers represented by linked lists. The key idea here is to first convert the linked list representation of these numbers into an actual integer, perform the addition operation on these integers, and then convert the resulting sum back into a linked list format.\n\nThe `addTwoNumbers` function consists of two helper functions: `toint` and `tolist`. The `toint` function takes a linked list node and recursively converts the linked list into an integer. It does this by accessing the value (`n.val`) of the current node and recursively multiplying the result from the next node by 10, effectively reversing the reverse-order storage of the digits in the linked list.\n\nAfter converting both input linked lists `l1` and `l2` to their integer forms using `toint`, the function adds these two integer values. Then, `tolist` comes into play. The `tolist` function is a recursive function that converts an integer back into a linked list. It creates a new `ListNode` with the value of the current digit (`n % 10`) and recursively handles the rest of the digits by calling itself on the integer division of `n` by 10 (`n // 10`). This splits the sum back into its individual digits and stores them in a linked list format.\n\nFinally, the `tolist` function is called with the resultant sum of the two converted integers, producing a linked list representation of this sum, which is then returned as the output of the `addTwoNumbers` function. This approach efficiently bridges the gap between linked list representations of numbers and their integer arithmetic."

    "title": "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters",
    "aiExplanation": "This code is designed to find the length of the longest substring in a given string `s` that doesn't contain any repeating characters. It achieves this using the sliding window technique, which involves maintaining a window of characters that dynamically adjusts as the algorithm progresses. The variable `ans` keeps track of the maximum length of the substring found so far. The variable `l` represents the left end of the sliding window, and `r` is the right end, which is iterated over the string using `enumerate`, giving both the character `c` and its index `r`. The `seen` set holds the unique characters currently within the window.\n\nAs the algorithm iterates over each character `c` from left to right, it checks if `c` is already in the `seen` set, indicating a repeated character. If `c` is found in `seen`, a nested while loop is executed that removes characters from the left of the window (starting from index `l`) until `c` can be safely added without repetition. This effectively moves the left end `l` of the window to the right, maintaining the non-repeating property. Once `c` is added to `seen`, the length of the current window (`r - l + 1`) is calculated and compared with `ans` to potentially update `ans` with the maximum length found. After iterating through the entire string, the solution returns `ans` as the length of the longest substring without repeating characters."
